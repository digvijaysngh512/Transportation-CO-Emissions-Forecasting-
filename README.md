The demand for transparency in sustainable development from investors and customers has grown over the years.

Investors have placed an increased emphasis on business sustainability when assessing an organization's value and resiliency.

Therefore, more organizations are investing resources to build capabilities for sustainability reporting and determine the best strategies for a sustainable supply chain.


## **Definition**
Based on the GHG Protocol corporate standard (Link), greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three scopes:

- Scope 1: direct emissions emissions released to the atmosphere because of the company’s activities (Company’s facilities like manufacturing plant/warehouses, company’s vehicles)
- Scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy
(purchased electricity, gas, ..)
- Scope 3: all indirect emissions (out of scope 2) occurring in the value chain of the company (Transportation, Waste of Operations, Business Travels, …)

In this article, we will focus on the Scope 3 calculations related to downstream transportation.
What is the environmental impact of your distribution network?



## **Objective**

1. Based on this formula, we collect and process data to calculate the emissions.


2. We calculate the unit of measure conversions considering the shipped handling units.



3. We add distances by mode and compute the CO2 emissions by order 




## #Conclusion
  Built a deep learning image captioning model using Flickr8k dataset, VGG16 CNN, and LSTM.
 Analyzed 10,000+ transportation records; key drivers- fuel type (35% impact), distance (27%), and vehicle (22%).
 Delivered insights on high emission vehicles 2.3× more carbon than their alternatives, guiding reduction strategies.|
